I need the real-time dashboard of 3 crypto currencies 
  a. If change is positive, render green
  b. If change is negative, render red
  c. If change is 0, render yellow

Bitcoins data is updated for every 10 seconds
Ethereum data is updated for every 15 seconds
Ripple data is updated for every 20 seconds

Note: You can just simple setInterval to call back-end api,
e.g., for bitcoin setInterval(() => {
/*YOUR CODE*/ }, 10000);

Back-end: please use express.js

Front-end: please use react.js

Please add unit test on both back-end, and front-end
You can search for free API to get crypto currencies data from google

I did with react js not with express js
